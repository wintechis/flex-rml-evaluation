# FlexRML Evaluation

This repository contains all files necessary to reproduce the benchmarks of [FlexRML](https://github.com/wintechis/flex-rml) and also contains our results.

The repository has 4 subfolders:

1. **Conformance**: 
   The code here is used to evaluate FlexRML against the RML test cases.

2. **Result Size Estimator**: 
   The code in this directory is used to evaluate the accuracy of FlexRML's Result Size Estimator.

3. **Adaptive Hash Selection**: 
   The code in this directory is used to evaluate the performance of FlexRML using adaptive hash size selection, compared to FlexRML using a fixed hash size of 128 bits.

4. **RML Processor Comparison**: 
   The code in this directory is used to evaluate FlexRML, Morph-KGC, and SDM-RDFizer against the GTFS Madrid benchmark and the SDM Genomics dataset.
